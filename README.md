# py-abm - Agent-Based Simulation in Python

(C) 2016 [Steve Phelps](http://sphelps.net)

This module provides simple base classes for developing agent-based models in Python.  

Features:

- Agents can be equipped with reinforcement-learning capabilities
using the [pybrain module](http://pybrain.org/).

- Multiple realisations of the model can be executed with different parameter settings.

- The results of simulations can be collected and analysed as a [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) data-frame.
